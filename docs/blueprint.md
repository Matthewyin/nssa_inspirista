- Accent color: Muted dark blue (#3B7197) to complement the primary color and create contrast for interactive elements. The dark blue creates emphasis for call to actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a modern and neutral look.
- Use minimalist, clean icons for actions like create, edit, and delete. Adopt an Apple-style icon design.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure easy navigation and content discovery. Design the layout to resemble Apple's clean and intuitive interface design.
- Incorporate subtle, non-intrusive animations for a smooth user experience. The animations should mimic the smooth transitions found in Apple's UI.
